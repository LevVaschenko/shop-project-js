### A simple product store with JavaScript animation

You can watch the site [here](https://levvaschenko.github.io/shop-project-js/) or run code with Live Server through Visual Studio Code

This site uses object animation from https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ and slider from https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

The site has a shopping cart with a product counter. When you click **ADD TO CART**, the counter simply increases.

There is also:

- modal window
- slider
- drop down boxes

Modal window and slider are made with JavaScript code.
